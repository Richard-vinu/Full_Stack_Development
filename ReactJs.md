```1)What are Hooks in Reacts?```
<br>
React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component. Hooks can be stateful and can manage side-effects. React provides a bunch of standard in-built hooks: useState : To manage states. Returns a stateful value and an updater function to update it.

2)```Why Hooks are used in React?```<br>
<br>
Hooks let you organize side effects in a component by what pieces are related (such as adding and removing a subscription), rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods. You can learn more about useEffect on a dedicated page: Using the Effect Hook.
