###  EC2
**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud** (**EC2**) is a part of [Amazon.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com "Amazon.com")'s [cloud-computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-computing "Cloud-computing") platform, [Amazon Web Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services "Amazon Web Services") (AWS), that allows users to rent [virtual computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_computer "Virtual computer") on which to run their own computer applications.

 - EC2 encourages scalable deployment of applications by providing a [web service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service "Web service") through which a user can boot an [Amazon Machine Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Machine_Image "Amazon Machine Image") (AMI) to configure a [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Machine "Virtual Machine"), which Amazon calls an "instance",containing any software desired.
