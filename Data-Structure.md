### 1) What is Data Structure? Explain.

The data structure is a way that specifies how to organize and manipulate the data. It also defines the relationship between them. Some examples of Data Structures are arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc. Data Structures are the central part of many computer science algorithms as they enable the programmers to handle the data in an efficient way


## Linked List

-   Linked List can be defined as collection of objects called  **nodes**  that are randomly stored in the memory.
-   A node contains two fields i.e. data stored at that particular address and the pointer which contains the address of the next node in the memory.
-   The last node of the list contains pointer to the null.![enter image description here](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/linked-list.png)
