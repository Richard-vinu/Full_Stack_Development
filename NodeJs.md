<br>

```Soap ( Simple object access protocol)```<br>
* soap is like using an envelope
*Communication happens using XML only
* more bandwidth
* Heavy, more secure, more stable
*more work on  both ends(sealing and opening) more secure

```Rest (Representational State Transfer Application programming interface)```<br>
*Rest is like a postcard<br>
*Communication happens using Json, XML<br>
*ligthweight <br>
*can be cached <br>
*easier to update <br>
*- Easy to develop and automate <br>

Who is developed Nodejs

    Ryan Dahl developed it in 2009, and its latest iteration, version 15.14, was released in April 2021. Developers use Node.
    Node. js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library for running web applications outside the client's browser.
    Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
    Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

What is Node.js?

    Node.js is free
    Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
    Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

What Can Node.js Do?

    Node.js can generate dynamic page content
    Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
    Node.js can collect form data
    Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database

What is a Node.js File?

    Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
    A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
    Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect
    Node.js files have extension ".js"

What is a Module in Node.js?<br>
```yaml
Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.
A set of functions you want to include in your application.
Built-in Modules
Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
```
What is NPM?
```yaml
NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules if you like.

www.npmjs.com hosts thousands of free packages to download and use.

The NPM program is installed on your computer when you install Node.js

NPM is already ready to run on your computer!

```
What is Body-parser<br>

What is a Package?
```yaml
A package in Node.js contains all the files you need for a module.

Modules are JavaScript libraries you can include in your project.

```What is the difference between REST and SOAP APIs?```

There are different services available for communication between client and server. Two of them are widely used, i.e., REST and SOAP APIs. Both services have a client that requests data and a server that responds.

Before we go into the differences between these two services, letâ€™s understand what they are first.

What is the REST API?

REST API is one of the most common types of API. REST APIs allow you to perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations between a client and a server. It connects your backend with your frontend so they can communicate with each other.

What is the SOAP API?

SOAP API is another kind of web service that allows communication between client and server. Any web service that complies with the SOAP web services specification is a SOAP web service. The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) is behind these specifications.

Differences Between REST and SOAP API
There are several differences between REST and SOAP APIs because the entire architecture is different.

Here are how SOAP API is different from the REST API:

Language, platform, and transport-independent. On the contrary, the REST API requires the use of HTTP.
Works well in distributed enterprise environments, whereas REST assumes direct point-to-point communication.
The SOAP API is more standardized.
SOAP API provides significant pre-build extensibility in the form of the WS* standards.
There is built-in error handling in the SOAP API.
Now here are how REST API is different from the SOAP API:

It has a smaller learning curve as compared to the SOAP API.
It is more efficient. SOAP uses XML for all messages, whereas REST primarily uses smaller message formats like JSON.
REST API is faster than SOAP API because it does not require extensive processing.
REST API uses easy-to-understand standards like swagger and OpenAPI Specification 3.0.
It is much closer to other web technologies in design philosophy than SOAP.
