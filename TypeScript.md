What is TypeScript?<br>

TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.<br>

TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.


How do I use TypeScript?
A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.

The next section shows how to get the compiler setup for a local project.

Some popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, have built-in TypeScript support and can show errors as you write code!
